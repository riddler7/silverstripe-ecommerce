## Troubleshooting

Here are some problems/questions to help you resolve troubles with your ecommerce site.

### All/some products do not show up

Things to check:

 * Is the shop closed? (see the site config)
 * Do the products have a price?
 * Are the product pages in 'draft' mode, and not published?
 * Have you enabled the 'Allow Purchase' checkbox for each product? [](AddingEditingProduct#AllowPurchase)

If you are using the stock module:

 * Do you have products in stock?

If you are using the variations module:

 * Do you have variations?
 * Do they have price/stock?
