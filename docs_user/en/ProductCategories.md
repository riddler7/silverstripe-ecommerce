Product Groups (Categories)
===========================

Product groups are a mechanism for categorising products on the site.
They allow for easier navigation of products, particularly when there are more than 100 listed on your site.

A product group is created like any other page, except you choose 'Product Group' from the drop-down of page types.

On the front-end of the site, each product group will also display products that can be found within sub product groups.

You can add products to additional secondary groups in the edit product interface.
