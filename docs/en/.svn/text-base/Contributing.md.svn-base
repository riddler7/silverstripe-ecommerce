# Contributing to the eCommerce module

## Development Guidelines

We try to match [SilverStripe's guidelines](http://doc.silverstripe.org/sapphire/en/misc/contributing) as closely as possible. In some ways our approach will differ, but it is a good idea to read their guidelines first.

The eCommerce module is hosted on the Google code project hosting platform, which has {a number of features](http://code.google.com/projecthosting/).

* Please use the [google code version control integration features](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/IssueTracker#Integration_with_version_control).
